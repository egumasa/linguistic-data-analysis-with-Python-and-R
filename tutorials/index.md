## Course Units

This course is organized into interactive learning units that combine conceptual slides with hands-on programming assignments. Each unit includes:

- **Interactive slides** with live Python examples (runs in your browser)
- **Assignment notebooks** with real spaCy tasks (launches in Binder or Colab)
- **Progressive learning** from basic concepts to advanced applications

## Learning Path

We recommend completing the units in order, as each builds upon concepts from the previous units:

1. **Start here:** [Unit 1 - spaCy Basics](01-spacy-basics/index.md)
2. **Then:** [Unit 2 - Tokens & POS](02-tokens-pos/index.md)
3. **Continue with:** [Unit 3 - Dependencies & NER](03-deps-ner/index.md)
4. **Finish with:** [Unit 4 - Pipelines](04-pipelines/index.md)
